"""Cleans up a notebook's metadata and outputs: for use from contributors.

If you would like to contribute or modify notebooks, please run this script
to ensure that all notebooks in the project have cell outputs erased, and any
metadata from other notebook editors (e.g. colab) are removed.

Run this script as follows:

python cleanup_notebooks.py [project-base-directory]

If already in the base directory, run:

python cleanup_notebooks.py .
