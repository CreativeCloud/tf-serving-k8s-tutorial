We simply have to take the Keras model, and set its inputs field and output fields in the prediction signature definition in the Tensorflow saved_model library. (Compare this to the Estimator API, where the input signature is defined by the `serving_input_receiver_fn()` dictionary argument, and the output signature is defined by the EstimatorSpec constructor's export_outputs field in the model_fn.\n",
